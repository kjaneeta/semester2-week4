# Task 1 - character arrays and strings

1. **character arrays are not strings**

Small example showing how character arrays differ from strings.

Challenge: 
- Explain why printing the array as a string (%s) causes a strange result.
- Hint: Change the second string to something other than "hello".

2. **String library**

The program `string_ops.c` requires you to test some C string library functions.


Note: 
- We declare the strings with space for additional characters
- Operations such as concatenation are "in place",
- ie. they use the existing string and expect space to be available
